# HomeTest
Dear reviewer

One point I would like to make is that on the 4th user story you asked, I decided to validate just the visibility of the tooltip. I didn't validate the percentages just because it wouldn't be flexible as you said in your notes. (Any percentage change would have broke the tests since I can't validate though the DB).

In order to run the test just CD into the project folder and just run "npm run cypress:open" on your terminal

Thank you for the opportunity 

Denys
