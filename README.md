# HomeTest
To Open Cypress Run: npm run cypress:open

First of all want to say thank you for this opportunity. 

For the last step where I was asked to verify tooltip with the text for each state or group of states,
I decided to go with a non-changing part of the text which is "% of Students".
I could do the same method with 2 parameters and it would concatenate the numbers into 'contains'. 
But then as you said if numbers would change I would have to go and change them manually.
Also, I want to add that I have only one spec file because I'm not working to deep with the pages. Otherwise, I think every page should be under its own spec file.
